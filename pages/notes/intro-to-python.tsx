            <p>
              Python is a high-level programming language that was created by
              Guido van Rossum in the 1980s. Its simple syntax emphasizes
              readability. Unlike many other programming languages, Python code
              often reads like natural English sentences. According to{" "}

              </a>
              , Python is the world's most popular programming language. What
              makes Python so charming?
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>It's easy to read and write.</li>
              <li>It's open-source and free.</li>
              <li>
                There are thousdands of <em>packages</em> available.
              </li>
              <li>
                It's versatile. You can use Python for data science (machine
                learning, deep learning, AI), web development, desktop app
                development, low-level programs, game programming, and more.
              </li>
              <li>It has a massive community of users and supporters.</li>

            <h3>Python and Data Analytics</h3>

            <span className="label blue">Why do we use Python?</span>
            <p>
              Python is an ideal language for data analytics for many reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, Python has a wide offering of data analysis and
              visualization libraries.{" "}
              <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> is the de-facto
              standard library for data analysis which we will learn in one of
              the later chapters. Libraries like{" "}
              <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> and{" "}
              <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> are used for machine
              learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, Python offers a higher development speed, especially when
              it comes to working with data. Data analysts can quickly perform
              exploratory data analysis to obtain a high-level understanding of
              a dataset. They can also prototype a statistical model with
              well-maintained libraries and a few lines of code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, Python is a great beginner's language. Recall that the
              Python syntax is human-readable. You can often <em>guess</em> what
              some code is doing even if you don't fully understand Python.
